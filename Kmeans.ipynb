    "K-means is one of the most common data processing algorithms. The algorithms obtain an excellent final solution by employing proper initialization. However, from a theoretical perspective concerning quality and efficiency, k-means is not a suitable clustering algorithm. This is because in the worst case it produces a final solution which is locally optimal, although it doesn't meet the typical global optimum. Besides, this paper will discuss the keys that were applied in the process improving k-means from traditional to the current modern algorithm. The big step taken was to develop the initialization procedure of traditional k-means which changed the performance of Lloyd's iteration. The improvement resulted in k-means++ algorithm which improves upon the running time of iteration. The algorithm picks only the first cluster center consistently at random from the data and probability is used in selecting the subsequent cluster center. Initialization of k-means++ leads to an O(log K) which is an approximation of the solution optimum. However, K-means++ algorithm has its downside which is being intrinsically sequential. Although it has a total running of 0(nkd), its k-clustering is similar to that of a single Lloyd's iteration. The downside led to obtainment a parallel version of k-means++ known as k-means||. The k-means|| algorithm uses the idea of sampling O(k) points per round, and the process is repeated to O(log n) rounds. Moreover, at the end the algorithm only O(k log n) points are left, which form a solution in a constant factor."

    "In data mining and processing, some specifics algorithms are applied to cluster or group the data to meaningful information. Those algorithms are referred as clustering algorithms. In this case, scalable k-means paper is used in the research about of k-means algorithms, their efficiency in operation and the solution they offer in data mining processes. K-means clustering algorithms are used when data is unbalanced that is data without defined groups or categories (Bahmani, Moseley, Vattani, Kumar & Vassilvitskii, 2012). These algorithms aim to group data into clusters whereby variable k represents the number of groups or cluster. Besides, the algorithm works iteratively to allocate every data point to a single k group by use of provided attributes. It should be noted that data points are clustered on the ground of feature similarity. K-means results in centroids of the k clusters that are used in new data labeling and markers for the training data."

    "The k-means algorithm can be useful in almost all the fields. The algorithm is used in data clustering applications in different areas (Bahmani, Moseley, Vattani, Kumar & Vassilvitskii, 2012). For instance, clustering helps marketers advance their customers base as well as work on the goal areas. The k-means help group people using different criteria including purchasing power and willingness. The grouping is on the basis of their similarity in several ways which are related to the product under deliberation. In addition, clustering can be used to study earthquake. K-means analyses shows the next likely location where an earthquake can transpire by use of available data on the areas hit by the quake in a region. Moreover, k-means algorithm is mostly applied in large database management systems whereby data is mined, cleaned and analyzed for useful information. The advantage of k-means is that it is computationally faster than other clustering algorithms such as hierarchical clustering algorithm. The main disadvantage is that k-means cannot grip non-globular data of diverse sizes and densities."

    "Advantages:\n",
    "+ Hierarchical clustering outputs a hierarchy, ie a structure that is more informaHve than the unstructured set of flat clusters returned by k-means. Therefore, it is easier to decide on the number of clusters by looking at the dendrogram (see suggesHon on how to cut a dendrogram in lab8).\n",
    "+ Easy to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "+ It is not possible to undo the previous step: once the instances have been assigned to a cluster, they can no longer be moved around.\n",
    "+ Time complexity: not suitable for large datasets\n",
    "+ Initial seeds have a strong impact on the final results\n",
    "+ The order of the data has an impact on the final results \n",

At each step of the algorithm, the two clusters that are the most similar are combined into a new bigger cluster, which can be regarded as node. This procedure is iterated until all points are member of just one single big cluster, which is root. Hierarchical clustering does not require us to prespecify the number of clusters. The advantage of hierarchical clustering come at the cost of lower efficiency."
